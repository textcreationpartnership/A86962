            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Earned and Reverend Brethren; If you be now (as is ſuppoſed) upon the adviſe of a Form of Church-Government; I beſeech you, in the fear of God, ſetting aſide all prejudice, to take into your ſad thoughts theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations following.</p>
            <p>It is (I perceive) an uſual Prayer of many Preachers well affected to your Aſſembly, that God would now after 1600 years univerſal practiſe of the whole Church of Chriſt, upon earth) ſhew you the Pattern in the Mount; as if, after ſo long and perfect inquintions, there could be any new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the form that was, or ſhould be; wherein, I ſuppoſe their well-meaning is not a little injurious both to the known truth, and to you: For, what Revelations can we expect thus late? Or what Monuments of either Scripture or Hiſtory can now be hoped to be brought to light, which your eyes have not ſeen, and former ages have not enquired into! Surely ye well know, there can be but theſe three Forms of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, poſſibly deviſed; Either by Biſhops, or by Presbyteries, or by the multitude of ſeveral and ſelect Congregations: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which, have both their Abettors and their Adverſaries:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168924:3"/>The firſt hath all times and places, ſince the daies of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles, till this age, to ſtand for it: The ſecond hath the late perſecuted, reformed Church of <hi>France</hi> (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſired, nor meant to make their neceſſitated form a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for others) the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for Precedent of it: The third hath the Miniſters of <hi>New-England,</hi> and their aſſociates, commonly ſtyled by the name of INDEPENDENTS, vehemently contending for it: The Adverſaries of every of theſe, are as well known, as their friends; and the Pleas which every of them makes for it ſelf, are as well known as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is yet <hi>res integra;</hi> elſe, I ſhould lay my finger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my lips: Both the Houſes of Parliament, your Aſſembly, and the whole Kingdom, ſtand yet free, and unengaged to any part: For the National Covenant (as it is interpreted by ſome of your ſelves, and thoſe other Divines, whoſe allowed Sermons have commented upon it) intends not to abjure and diſclaim Epiſcopacy, as ſuch; but only bends againſt the whole preſent Fabrick of Government, as it is built on theſe Arches, theſe Pedeſtals; ſo as if it be taken aſunder from thoſe (ſome of them, not neceſſary) appendances, you are no way foreſtalled in your judgment againſt it; nor any other, that hath lift up his hand in this ſolemn Covenant.</p>
            <p>That I may not urge the Latine Tranſlation of the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, printed and ſent abroad to the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> and other Churches, which ran only upon <hi>tyrannicum reg men Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum;</hi> that only the Tyrannical Government of the Prelates, not their fatherly and brotherly preeminence, is there abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Your wiſdomes know well how to diſtinguiſh betwixt a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the abuſes of the execution thereof; betwixt the main ſubſtance of a Calling, and the circumſtantial and ſeparable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances thereunto; from which it may be deveſted, and yet ſtand entire.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be a flatterer of the times paſt (which is not often ſeen) if I ſhould take upon me to juſtifie or approve of all the carriages of ſome that have been entruſted with the Keyes of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Government; or to blanch over the Corruptions of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168924:3"/>Conſiſtorial Officers; in both theſe, there was fault enough, to ground both a complaint and Reformation: And may that man never proſper, that deſires not an happy Reformation of what ever hath been, or is amiſs in the Church of God: But this I offer to your ſerious conſideration, whether Epiſcopacy, ſtripped of all circumſtances that may be juſtly excepted againſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Primitive eſtate, may not be thought a Form, both better in it ſelf, and more fit for this Kingdom and Church, than either of the other.</p>
            <p>How ancient it is, I need not appeal to any but your ſelves; who do well know, that there was never yet any Hiſtory of the Church, wherein there was not full mention made of Biſhops, as the only Governours thereof; neither can any Learned adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary deny, that they have continued, with the general allowance of Gods Church, from the very Apoſtolick times, until this preſent age. And whether it can be ſafe, and lie not open to much ſcandal, to exchange ſo ancient an Inſtitution, hitherto perpetuated to the Church, for a new, where no neceſſity inforces us, judge ye.</p>
            <p>How univerſal it is, being the only received Government of all the Chriſtian Churches over the face of the whole earth (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this ſmall Spot of our Neighbourhood) ye know as well as the undoubted Relation of the <hi>Christianography</hi> can tell you: And how unſafe it may be, to depart from the Form of all the Churches, that profeſs the Name of Chriſt (who do all ſubmit themſelves to Biſhops, or Superintendents, except the fore-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) I leave to your grave judgment.</p>
            <p>Beſides, how Epiſcopacy is, and hath long been ſetled in this Kingdom, and (as it were) incorporated into it, and enwoven into the Municipal Lawes of this Land, ſo as that it cannot be utterly removed, without much alteration in the whole body of our Lawes; is a matter well worthy of not the leaſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>But, all theſe would yet ſeem light upon the Ballance, if there were not an intrinſecal worth in the Inſtitution it ſelf, that might ſway with you: The Covenant binds to the endeavour of ſuch a Government, as is according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches. An now let
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168924:4"/>me appeal to your own hearts, and the hearts of all judicious and unprejudicate Readers, whether the Rules of Church-Government laid forth in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> do not ſuppoſe and import that very proper Juriſdiction, which is claimed by Epiſcopacy at this day: Which, if it were not intended to be left as a perfect pattern to ſucceſſion; the whole Church of Chriſt ſhould have been left in the dark, without any direction for the ſucceeding adminiſtration thereof: Thoſe Charges are plainly given, not to many, but to one; and do moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply, not a parity, but preeminence and power.</p>
            <p>And if the example of the beſt Churches muſt carry it: What Church could be more pure, and more fit for our imitation than the Primitive? And that part of it, which immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtles of our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? And do not you full well know, that our Hiſtories and unqueſtionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors name the men, whom thoſe Apoſtles, by impoſition of hands, ordained to this Function? Do not <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Polycrates, Egeſippus, Clemens, Euſebius, Jerome,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe perſons, who ſucceeded each other in thoſe firſt Sees? If you tell me of the difference betwixt the Epiſcopacy of thoſe firſt ages of the Church, and that of the preſent times; I do willingly yield it, but withal, I muſt add, that it is not in any thing eſſential to the calling, but in matters outward, and meerly adventitious; the abatement whereof (if it ſhall be found needful) diminiſheth nothing from the ſubſtance of that holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: What can be more expreſs, than in the ancienteſt of them, the bleſſed Martyr, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the mention of the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct degrees of Biſhops, Presbyters, Deacons; encharged with their ſeveral duties, which were yet never intermitted, and let fall to this preſent day: How frequently and vehemently doth be in his genuine Epiſtles (twice in that to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) call for due ſubjection to the Biſhop and the Presbytery? How di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly doth he in his epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> name their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, <hi>Dama;</hi> and their Presbyters, <hi>Baſſus, Apollonius, Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus?</hi> How doth he in his epiſtle <hi>ad Trallianos,</hi> ſet forth the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Presbytery, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. And if any man ſhall be ſo unjuſtly ſcrupulous, as to call into queſtion the credit of this gracious Author, (reſerved, no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168924:4"/>doubt, by a ſpecial Providence, for the conviction of the Schiſms of theſe laſt times) therein out-doing <hi>Vedelius</hi> himſelf, (who floudy aſſereth ſome of theſe Epiſtles, whilſt he rejects others as ſuppoſitious) let him caſt his eyes upon the no leſs famous and holy Martyr, and Biſhop, <hi>Polycarpus;</hi> who (as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iren. adver. haereſ. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Author tels us, one, whoſe eyes beheld that Saint) did not only converſe with thoſe that had ſeen Chriſt, but alſo was by the Apoſtles conſtituted in <hi>Aſia,</hi> Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Let him, if he can, deny <hi>Cyprian</hi> the holy Martyr and Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> writing familiarly to the Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons there; ſomtimes gravely reproving them, ſomtimes father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſhing them of their duties, in divers of his Epiſtles. Let him deny that his contemporanie <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledgeth 45 Presbyters committed by the Catholick Church, to his charge: Shortly, let him, if he ſtick at this truth, deny that there was any Chriſtian Church of old, any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
            <p>All which duly conſidered, I would fain know what reaſon can be ſhewed, why that ancient, yea firſt Government by the Biſhop and his Presbytery, received, and with all good approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſucceſs, uſed in the Primitive Church, and derived (though not without ſome faulty omiſſions and intertextures, which may eaſily be remedied) until this preſent day, ſhould not rather take place, than a Government lately and occaſionally rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in the Church, for neceſſity, or convenience of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Places and perſons; without any intention of an univerſal rule and preſcription.</p>
            <p>If you ſhall ſay that this Government by Biſhops hath been ſound, by ſad experience, hitherto, a block in the way of perfect Reformation, deſtructive to the power of Godlineſs, and pure Adminiſtration of the Ordinances of Chriſt, give me leave to anſwer; That firſt, I fear, the Independent Party will be apt to ſay no leſs of the Presbyterian; boldly preſſing their defects, both in conſtitution and practiſe; and publickly averring, the exquiſitely reformed way to lie betwixt the Epiſcopal and Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, which they have had the happineſs to light upon; neither want there thoſe, who, upon challenge of further illumination, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave thoſe Semi-ſeparariſts, as coming far too ſhort of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168924:5"/>of Reformation, which themſelves have attained.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I muſt in the fear of God, beſeech you here to make uſe of that neceſſary diſtinction, betwixt Callings and Perſons; for it oftentimes fals out, that the Calling unjuſtly ſuffers for that, whereof only the Perſon is guilty: Let the Calling be never ſo holy, and the Rules of Adminiſtration never ſo wiſe and perfect, yet if the Perſon, in whoſe truſt they are, be either negligent or corrupt, or impotent in ordering his paſſions and carriage, it cannot be, but all things muſt go amiſs, and much diſorder and confuſion muſt needs follow to the Church of God; and if ſuch hath been the caſe in ſome late times, why ſhould the blame be laid upon the Calling, which both is innocent, and might have been better improved? Give me a Biſhop (ſuch there have been, and ſuch there are, let Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi> for inſtance, be one) that is truly conſcionable, pious, painful, zealous in promoting the Glory of God, ready to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all faithful Preachers, and to cenſure and correct the lazy and ſcandalous, careful of the due impoſition of his hands, meek and unblameable in all his carriage; and now tell me how the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſuch an one (regulated by the holy and wholſom Lawes of our Church) can be ſaid to be obſtructive to the ſucceſs of the Goſpel, or to deſtroy the power of Godlineſs? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if all be not ſuch, the fault is in the men; their Calling doth not only admit of, but incites them to all vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whereof if they be defective, let the Perſon take off the blame from the Function.</p>
            <p>Neither doubt I to affirm, that it may well be made good, that the perfecteſt Reformation, which the Church of God can be capable of, here upon earth, may conſiſt with Epiſcopacy, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, as it may be, if it pleaſe the High Court of Parliament to pitch upon that courſe: And indeed, how can it be conceived, that the careful inſpection of one conſtant, prudent, and vigilant over-ſeer, ſuper-added to a grave and judicious Presbytery, ſhould be any hinderance to the progreſs of godlineſs? eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he is ſo limited by the bounds of good Lawes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, that he cannot run out, without the danger of a juſt cenſure: There are already many excellent Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they were awaked, an dactuated by full authority; and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168924:5"/>where there is any deficiency, more might be eaſily added to make the body of Church-Lawes compleat.</p>
            <p>To give a taſt of what may be effected, with very little or no alteration of one Form of Government to another.</p>
            <p>I remember one of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Diſcourſe tending to the advancing of the Presbyterian way, tels us, that Dr. <hi>Momague,</hi> the Late worthy Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> asked King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory, (whoſe ſweet affability the world well knew) <hi>How it came about, that there were ſo few Hereſies and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Doctrine, broached, and proſecuted, to the publick diſturbance of the Church of Scotland?</hi> Unto which, the wiſe and Learned King is ſaid to have returned this Anſwer; <hi>That every Pariſh hath their Paſtor ever preſent with them, and watching over them; That the Paſtor hath his Elders and Deacons, ſorted with him; that he with them, once a week, meets at a ſet time and place, for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of manners, or what ever diſorder falls out in the Pariſh; ſo as he by this means, perfectly knows his Flock, and every aberration of them, either in matter of opinion or practice: And leſt any errour or hereſie may ſeize upon the Paſtor, they have their Presbyteries, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeveral Shrivalties, which meet together in the chief Town or City next to them, every week alſo once; and have there their exerciſe of Prophecying; after which the Moderator of the ſaid Meeting asks and gathers the judgments of all the ſaid Pastors, concerning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then delivered, or of any other doubtful point, that is then and there propounded; And if the ſaid Presbyters be divided in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, then the Question is, under an enjoyned ſilence, put over to the next Synod, which is held twice a year; unto that, all the Paſtors of that Quarter or Province duly reſort, accompanied with their Elders: The Moderator of the former Synod begins the Action; then a new moderator is choſen for the preſent, or (as it ſeldom fals out) the laſt Moderator, by Voices continued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Any Question of doubt being propoſed, is either decided by that Meeting, or (if it cannot be ſo done) is, with charge of ſilence, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till the National Synod or General Aſsembly, which they hold eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year once: Whither come not the Paſtors only, but the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his Commiſſioners; and ſome of all Orders and degrees, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently authorized for the determining of any Controverſie that ſhall ariſe amongſt them:</hi> Thus he. And certainly this bears the face of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168924:6"/>very fair and laudable courſe, and ſuch, as deſerves the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the well-willers to that Diſcipline: But let me add, that we either have, or may have (in this very ſame ſtate of things, with ſome ſmall variation) in effect, the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us; only there wants ſome care and life in their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which might, without much difficulty, be redreſſed: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pariſh hath, or by Law ought to have their Miniſter ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, and carefully watching over them. In ſtead then of their Paſtors, Elders and Deacons, we have in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, the Miniſter, whether a Rector or Vicar; Churchwardens, Queſt-men or Side-men, and Overſeers for the Poor; and in places of any eminence, a Curate or Aſſiſtant to the Rector, who is a Deacon at leaſt: Theſe may and ought, and in ſome places do duly meet together, every Week, on a ſet day, in their Veſtry, and decide ſuch differences as happen amongſt them; and may well be enjoyned to take notice of ſuch abuſes and miſ-demeanors as are incident in their Pariſh, for their ſpeedy reformation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Verge of their own power.</p>
            <p>In ſtead of their Presbyteries, conſiſting of ſeveral Paſtors, we have our number, and combination of Miniſters, in the diviſions of our ſeveral Deanries; under which, are ranged all the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters within that circuit; Over whom the Rural Dean (as he is called) is every year choſen, by the ſaid Miniſters of that Diviſion, as their Moderator, for the year enſuing; whoſe Office (if it were carefully looked unto, and reduced to the original Inſtitution) might be of ſingular uſe to Gods Church: This Deanry or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, conſiſting of ſeveral Paſtors, may be injoyned to meet together every Moneth, or oftner (if it ſeem fit) in ſome City or Town next unto them, and may there have their exerciſe of Propheſying, as I have known it practiſed in ſome Parts of this Kingdom: and as it is earneſtly wiſhed and recommended by that excellently Learned Lord <hi>Verulame,</hi> Late Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> in his prudent Conſiderations: and then, and there may endeavour to decide any doubt, that may ariſe in their ſeveral Pariſhes; either concerning the Doctrine of their Miniſter, or ſcruple in caſes of Conſcience, and may tranſact any publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that may concern their whole Diviſion: But if any ſuch matter or queſtion ſhall ariſe, as their divided opinions cannot
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168924:6"/>fully determine; it may (under charge of ſilence) be put over to a more publique meeting; which is the ſynodall aſſembly of the Clergy held twice a year, under the moderation (hitherto) of the Archdeacon; And if there the queſtion fail, of a full determination, it is, or may be referred, (with like ſilence and peace) to a Dioceſan Synod, which may be held every year once; under the preſidency of the Biſhop; And if yet the deciſion come not home, it may be referred to the determining of a Provincial Synod, or yet higher, to a Nationall: So as in theſe caſes of doubts, or errors, if men would not be wanting to themſelves, nothing needs be wanting in the ſtate we now ſtand in, to the ſafety, and happineſs of our Church.</p>
            <p>For matter of Ordination of Miniſters; the former Conſtitutions of our Church, have deeply enjoined the preſence, and aſſiſtance of thoſe, who by their original inſtitution, are the Presbytery of the Biſhop, at, and, in, the examination, and allowance of the perſons to be ordained; requiting alſo, the joynt-impoſition of thoſe hands, which atteſted the ſufficiency of the ſaid Examinates; not without a ſevere ſanction of two years ſuſpenſion, or the Act of Ordaining, to paſs upon any Biſhop, or Suffragane, that ſhall be found failing in any of the particulars; The qualification of thoſe that are to be ordained, is in our Canons already ſet forth, with much caution; for their age, their degrees, their abilities, the teſtimony of their holy converſation; neither need I doubt to affirm, that he, who (beſides all other circumſtances of education) is able to give a good account of his faith in Latine, according to the received Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to confirm the ſame by ſufficient teſtimonies, out of the holy Scripture, may be thought competently ſit, (for matter of knowledg) to enter upon the firſt ſtep of Deacon ſhip; which the wiſdome of the Church hath (according to the Apoſtles rule) appointed (not without a ſufficient diſtance of time) in way of probation, to the higher order of Miniſtry, forbidding to give both Orders at once; and requiting, that he, who is ordained Deacon, ſhall continue a whole year, at leaſt, in that ſtation, except upon ſome weighty reaſons, it ſhall ſeem fit to the Biſhop, to contract the time limited: And, leſt there ſhould be any ſubreption in this ſacred buſineſs, it is Ordered, that theſe Ordinations ſhould be no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168924:7"/>other than ſolemn, both in reſpect of time and place; neither ought they to be, nor in ſome places are, without a publick preconization of lawfull warning affixed upon the Cathedrall Church door, where the ſaid Ordination ſhall be celebrated; and over and beſides the charge, that none ſhall be admitted to be a Candidate of holy Orders, but he who brings ſufficient teſtimonials of his good life and converſation, under the ſeal of ſome Colledg in <hi>Cambridg</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> or of three, or four grave Miniſters, together with the ſubſcription and teſtimony of other credible perſons, who have known his life and behaviour, by the ſpace of three years next before; it is well known to you, that before the Act of Ordination there is publick Proclamation made to the whole Aſſembly, that if any man knowes any crime or impediment in any of the perſons preſented, for which he ought not to be ordained, that he ſhould come forth and declare it before any hand be laid upon his head, for his full admiſſion.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which care of our dear Mother the Church of England; if it ſhall be thought meet, that any further act of Tryall, ſhall paſs upon thoſe, which are ſuitors for Ordination, how eaſily may it be ordered, that at the monethly (or if need be, more frequent) meeting of the Miniſters, within the ſame Presbyterie, or Deanrie; they may be appointed to make tryall of their gifts, and undergo ſuch further examination of their abilities, as ſhall be thought requiſite, ere they ſhall be preſented, and admitted by the Biſhop and his Presbyterie to that holy function.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is much ſtood upon, that it is meet the people, (whoſe ſoules muſt have right in him, to whoſe truſt they are committed) ſhould have ſome hand in their conſent to that Paſtor, by whom they muſt be fed; it muſt be ſaid, that beſides their devolution of their right to the Patron, who, as their Truſtee, preſents a Miniſter for them, it may be no prejudice at all to the power which by Law and Inheritance is ſettled upon the Patron, that the perſon whom his choice pitches upon, be appointed beforehand to preach, (for a tryal) to that Congregation to which he is ſo deſigned, and if either for his voice, or other juſt exceptions he be found unmeet for them, that another, more fit may be recommended by the ſaid Patron to the place; but if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168924:7"/>through faction, or ſelf-will or partiality, the multitude ſhall prove peeviſh, and faſtidious, they may, in ſuch a caſe, be over-ruled by juſt authority.</p>
            <p>As for matter of cenſures, it may not be denied, that there hath been great abuſe in the managing of them, both upon Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and others: ſuſpenſion of Miniſters upon flight, and inſufficient cauſes; both <hi>ab officio,</hi> and <hi>beneficio,</hi> hath been too rife in ſome places of latter times; and the dreadful Sentence of Excommunication hath too frequently, and familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed upon light and trivial matters: How happy were it, if a ſpeedy courſe may be taken, for the prevention of this evill; In the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> a motion was ſtrongly made to this purpoſe, but without effect; if the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the preſent Parliament ſhall ſettle ſome other way for the curbing of contumacious offences againſt Church-authority, it will be an act worthy of their care and juſtice. In the mean time, as for this, and all other Eccleſiaſtical proceedings, it may with much facility, and willing conſent of all parts, be ordered, that the Biſhop ſhall not take upon him to inflict either this, or any other important cenſure, without the concurrence of his Presbytery; which ſhall be a means (in all likelihood|) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any inconvenience that may ariſe from the wonted way of Judicature.</p>
            <p>As for the co-aſſeſſion of a Lay-Presbyterie, in ſwaying theſe affairs of Church-government; Ye well know how new it is; ſome of you might have been acquainted with the man that brought it firſt into any part of this Iſland; and what ground there is for it, either in Scripture, or antiquity, I appeal to your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Surely, the late learned Author of the Counſel for the reforming the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (although otherwiſe a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſertor of the French Diſcipline) ingenuouſly confeſſeth, that however thoſe Proteſtants which live under Popiſh Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, have done wiſely, in deputing ſome choice men, ſelected out of their Congregations, whom they call Elders, to ſhare with their Paſtors, in the care and management of Eccleſiaſtical affairs; Yet, thoſe Proteſtant Churches which live under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Proteſtant Princes, may with the ſafety of thoſe reſpects, which mutually intercede betwixt Paſtors and People,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168924:8"/>forbear any ſuch deputation: foraſmuch, as the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, transfers (for the moſt part) to himſelf, that, which is the wonted charge of thoſe deputed Elders; concluding, that thoſe men do meerly loſe their labour, who ſo buſily endeavour on the one ſide, to diſprove the antiquity of the Lay-Elderſhip; and, on the other, by weak proofs to maintain, (clean contrary to the mind of the Apoſtle) that the Text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) is to be underſtood of Paſtors, and Lay-Elders; Thus he, with what fair probability, I leave to your judgment.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any intention of mine to meddle with any piece of that Government, which obtaineth in other the Churches of God; but only, to contribute my poor opinion, concerning the now-to-be-ſetled affairs of our own.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I need to ſuggeſt unto you the dangerous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workings of other Sects? Secretly endeavouring to ſpring their hidden Mines to the overthrow both of the one Government, and the other; whereof, without ſpeedy remedy, perhaps it will be too late to complaine; no doubt, the wiſdom, and authority of that Great Senate (whom ye alſo ſerve to adviſe) will forthwith interpoſe it ſelf to the prevention of thoſe miſchiefs, which the variety of theſe Hereſies, and Sects (though ſome of them cloaked with the faireſt pretences) threaten to this poor Church: It is no boot for me to tell you, that the leſs diſunion there is, the more ground of ſafety; and that where the holy purpoſes of Reformation may be effected, with the leaſt change, there muſt needs be the moſt hope of accordance.</p>
            <p>The reſt to the wiſe application of the powerful and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; It is enough for me to have thus boldly ſhot my bolt amongſt you; and to have thus freely diſcovered my honeſt, and well-meant thoughts to ſo able judgements; What I want in my poor endeavours ſhall be ſupplied with my prayers, that God would be pleaſed to compoſe all our miſerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and to put an happy iſſue, to the long and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous agitations of this wofully, tottering, and bleeding Church and Kingdom; Which the good God of heaven vouchsafe to grant for his great mercies ſake, and for the ſake of the dear Sonne of his love Jeſus Chriſt, the Juſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
